Aruba has this nice little website with alot of information concerning network desgins and other topics. 

This content is from a family of technology guides called Aruba Validated Solution Guides (VSG). VSGs are cross-portfolio solution guides that cover multiple technology areas, including wired, wireless, data center, SD-WAN and security. They are validated by Arubaâ€™s Solution TME and Solution Quality Assurance teams on an ongoing basis using a rigorous process. A VSG provides prescriptive guidance focused on the Aruba recommended best practices specific to the solution being covered.

The goal is to describe a solution implementation which addresses the primary use cases for customer networks, while avoiding the corner cases. The intent is to enable partners and customers to efficiently install end-to-end solutions using Aruba technology in a consistent and repeatable manner. The result will be improved stability and supportability by limiting the number of deployment variations.

VSGs are categorized into volumes to differentiate each guide type from the others.

### Volumes
1. Design: Determine the solution design to meet a set of requirements.

2. Deploy: Step-by-step set of procedures to build the solution.

3. Migrate: Guidance for migrating from earlier architectures to ESP.
