### PRA Telenet DIUT2 card
It's not the first time that I had to connect an PRA to the DIUT2 card on an OSBiz X8 PABX. But I always forget the correct cable mapping between the card and the provider device. Telenet delivers PRA connections with Alcatel Lucent 1462EMC router connected over fiber. Check below picture with the SLA block to connect the correct PAIRS. *(you need to cross the blue pairs)*
