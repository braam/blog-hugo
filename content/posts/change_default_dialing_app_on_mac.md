I'm not a Mac user at all, so when a customer asked me to change the default dialing app on Mac I was like.. uuuuuhhh??!?
Lucky my google skills didn't let me down and I did found the solution very easily, this post is just to remember and share this setting with anyone who is interested in this:

To change the default calling app on Mac, open FaceTime on Mac, select "FaceTime" > "Preferences" > "Settings".

Change the "Default" for calls to the app you can choose from the list.
