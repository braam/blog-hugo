Sometimes customer do still have a really old PABX system like the Hipath 3000 series, when they still run in V3 then you know it's very old! The problem is when doing an addon to place a new telephone we do not always have the old telephones anymore. Lucky Siemens (Unify) has come up with a solution for this. The Openstage 10T, 15T and 30T can be set into a "Optipoint" mode. I never knew about this until now, that's why I like to write this down here :)
