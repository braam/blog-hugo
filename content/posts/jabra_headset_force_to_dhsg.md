We had this strange behaviour with some Jabra headsets, those headsets were like zombies on the desk phone, they didn't work at all. We connected them of course with the DHSG cable *Jabra Link 14201-10*, but still no life at all..

To fix the zombie headsets, the following actions have to be applied on headset side:

* The small wheel on the back of the headset base should be on "A".
* Now take the headset out of the base and hold it to your ear so that you can hear what it is saying.
* Press the + and - buttons on the headset (head section) at the same time and hold them down until you hear "Setup".
* Now press the call acceptance button on the outside of the headset several times in succession until you are in the "Remote Call Control (... is set to ...)" menu.
* You can now select the settings with the + or - button, please press one of the two repeatedly until you hear "DHSG".
* Now press and hold the + and - buttons together again until you hear "Goodbye".

Please restart the desk phone and the headset should be working again :-)
